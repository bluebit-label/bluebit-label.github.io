       Sarp, born in Ankara, Turkey, pursued a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Bilkent University. During their freshman year, they discovered a passion for Computer Science, particularly Machine Learning, prompting a curriculum adjustment to integrate Computer Science into their Electrical Engineering studies. Following their undergraduate studies, Sarp pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University, where they were introduced to Causal Machine Learning. Upon resuming their Master's degree at Bilkent University, Sarp focused on applying Causal ML to Robotics. Their current research interests encompass Causal Reinforcement Learning and exploring the potential applications of Causal ML in Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) and personal decision-making.
